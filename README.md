## Description
In this project we develop an application that is aimed for practitioner and coaches at a local gym here in Akureyri. The idea of the app is that the coaches can upload workouts into the app and practitioners can view them. We wanted to make an easy to navigate app, for all the users (coaches and practitioners). This app would then help the practictioners by giving them better access to the workouts before hand and allowing them to commit to an workout by reserving a slot. It also helps the coaches by allowing them to better manage what workouts they control and seeing how many practitioners are coming to said workouts. The owner of the gym would be an admin and he would be the one who added the users, both practitioners and coaches, to the application and could delete them from it as well. That way the admin of the app could have a nice overview of all the practitioners and coaches that he has employed.

This project was developed using Android Studios as development environments, GitHub for version control, Travis CI for continuous integration.
